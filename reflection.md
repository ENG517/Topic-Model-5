# Group 5: DITA Topic Model Reflection

#### Hello, Dr. Lindgren! Please view our explanations for each user scenario and DITA map below.

## User Scenario 1

#### Jane is hired as the new communication specialist for English Inc. As part of her job responsibilities, she must manage all aspects of English Inc.'s company LinkedIn page. In order to do this, her personal LinkedIn account must be designated as a "super admin" in English Inc. 's company LinkedIn page settings but she will need the help of a current employee to do this.


**_Ditamap Outline_** 
- concept: c_what_is_linkedin_admin
- tasks:
    - t_linkedin_become_company_admin
    - t_linkedin_current_company_admin
- reference: r_linkedin_roles

This map’s usage is primarily for novices. For that reason there is very minimal “expert” metadata tagging given that the topic model’s main audience is a novice/new hire. The map output covers the actual task, reference material for what each role’s responsibilities are, and concept material about what being a LinkedIn admin actually means/why a communication specialist would need to be classified as one.

## User Scenario 2

#### John is new to LinkedIn and wants to know what the social media platform is and what types of accounts he can utilize. John wants to learn how to create a LinkedIn account so he can begin to build a network of professionals within his field.

**_Ditamap Outline_** 
- concept: c_what_is_linkedin
- task: t_linkedin_create_account
- reference: r_types_of_linkedin_accounts

This map’s usage is primarily for extreme novices - i.e. someone that is entirely new, not only to a job position that requires LinkedIn, but to communications/social media work. Because the audience is an extreme novice, any information that is not necessary for a novice to know (like specifics of certain niche LinkedIn profiles) can be excluded using the metadata “expert” filter. The pdf this map produces would be useful for someone trying to learn more about the communications/social media fields or in industry, maybe an intern with little to no experience with LinkedIn.

The concept topic, task topic, and reference topic within this user scenario were created with reuse in mind because they are the most basic information needed to understand how to use LinkedIn. This is why portions of user-scenario-2.ditamap are used within the other user scenarios mentioned in this reflection. Before a novice user can learn how to be a company admin, they must understand types of LinkedIn accounts and how to create them. This user scenario creates the foundation for which other user scenarios are built from. 

## User Scenario 3

#### Louise just became social media manager to a student organization. Her club president completed the admin process with her during a club meeting, and now she's ready to start completing her club duties for the account. Since she doesn't have much experience with LinkedIn, she would love to learn more about some basic steps she can take to help monitor the club's account and establish herself as moderator.

**_Ditamap Outline_** 
- concept: c_linkedin_join_requests.dita
- task: t_managing_join_requests.dita
- task: t_writing_a_welcome_post.dita
- reference: r_linkedin_supported_files.dita

This map was designed for a novice LinkedIn user who had just received access to an admin page and is expecting to begin LinkedIn duties for their organization (in this case, a school club). The output of this information is a pdf for ease of use. It’s assumed the club leader can print the pdf to give the new LinkedIn admin, keep it in a shared documentation drive, or share it via email. The primary duties as an admin are managing join requests and making social posts. This documentation will walk them through the purpose of join requests, how to accept/decline join requests, how to write a welcome post (which also introduces them to the LinkedIn posting process as a whole - a transferable skill), and provide references for the types of media LinkedIn will allow them to upload. While not a comprehensive guide for their entire LinkedIn workflow, it’s a good entry point that teaches basic transferable skills without being overwhelming. 

## User Scenario 4

#### Sarah is the owner of a new start up and needs to provide LinkedIn documentation to her new social media manager - her spouse who has sworn off social media. Since they don't have much experience, her spouse wants to figure out the first steps of how to set up the business' online presence.

**_Ditamap Outline_** 
- concept: c_what_is_linkedin.dita
- reference: r_types_of_linkedin_accounts.dita
- task: t_linkedin_create_account.dita
- task: t_writing_a_welcome_post.dita
- reference: r_linkedin_supported_files.dita

Many small businesses or startups utilize family members and friends to participate in growing their business. It’s common to ask a significant other or friend to do the social media marketing for their business. This map addresses those situations. It’s a novice map that gives the basics of creating a platform account and making the account’s first post, which will help ease the new ‘social media manager’ into their role and teach them how to operate some key tools on the platform. LinkedIn isn’t as utilized as much in private life as platforms like Instagram, X, and Facebook, so the “What is LinkedIn” concept was added. The reference table allows users to see what kind of account they should create for their intended purpose. Then, they make their account and walk through their first post - a welcome post (and what files are supported). It’s in a PDF document for easy sharing and internal use, but a webpage may also be beneficial here. It’s a good guide for anyone who wishes to create a LinkedIn account and begin posting.
