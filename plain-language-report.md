# Group 5 - Plain Language Report

### Please click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VToAJsee-PwdmiTQ_LR2RuTbwosypRLkgHy9D8_o42k/edit?usp=sharing) to view our style guide. 

Since we designed with reuse in mind during phase one of our project, we did not have to complete many plan text edits. We highlighted some plain text editing work below. We edited to remove long-winded introductions, replacing them with active verbs and removed possible restrictive phrasing.

We also completed the suggested revision work, updating one of our reference tables, adding <uicontrol> when needed, and incorporating <result> and <stepresult> elements to some of our task topics. 

### Here are links to our individual pull-requests addressing these edits:
